# Phase 1 Lecture 1: Functions & Scope

## Objectives

By the end of today's lecture, you will be able to define function terminology as well as describe what scope is. You will also know how to code a basic function using normal, anonymous, and arrow syntax.

## Lesson Plan

1. Define and call a function _sayHello_ that console logs "Hello there!".
2. Define and call a function _sayHelloToYou_ that takes in a name and console logs "Hello there, [name]!".
    - What is the purpose of including a **parameter** and **argument** in this function?
    - What is the **scope** of the parameter?
3. Define and call a function _addTwoNumbers_ that takes in two numbers and returns their sum. Console log the sum outside the function definition.
    - How does the **function definition** differ from the **function call**?
    - What is the purpose of including the **return statement**?
    - What is the scope of the returned value?
4. Define an anonymous function that takes in a number and returns its square. Console log the square outside the function definition.
5. Define an arrow function that that takes in a number and returns its cube. Console log the cube outside the function definition.
    - Is there a more efficient way to write this?
6. Assign a variable _num1_ to 3 outside a function. Assign another variable _num2_ to 8 inside it. Increment both by 1 and console log both outside the function.
    - Why does _num1_ log but not _num2_? What does this tell us about scope?
    - How does calling the function affect the variable values?
    - What are the advantages and disadvantages of **global scope** vs **local scope**?

## Looking Ahead

Tomorrow's lecture will be on introducing the DOM and how we can manipulate it. While we won't be directly focusing on functions and scope, we will be incorporating them throughout the entirety of the lesson, and beyond in our programming journey.
